        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <p><em>Engineer at the Allen Institute for Cell Science</a></em></p>

        <p>Hi, I'm Karthik and I'm a data engineer at the Allen Institute for Cell Science. I work on the Modeling team at AICS which is focused on computational biology and machine learning projects at the Institute. Before this, I was an undergrad at UC Berkeley where I studied Computer Science and Biology and conducted computational cell biology research at the Drubin Lab.</p>

        <p>At the Drubin Lab, I worked on computational modeling of actin and associated proteins at endocytic sites based on novel cryo-electron tomography data with post-docs <a href = https://drubinbarneslab.berkeley.edu/people/matt-akamatsu/>Matt Akamatsu</a> and <a href = https://drubinbarneslab.berkeley.edu/people/daniel-serwas/>Daniel Serwas</a>. This experience was been a great immersion into the world of systems biology and, along with a collaboration at the <a href = "https://sites.google.com/eng.ucsd.edu/prangamani/home">Rangamani Lab</a> at UCSD, I've learned about the  benefits of interdisciplinary cell research, at the intersection of physics, biology and computer science.</p>
          
         <p> These experiences have fostered an appreciation for the power of computation and data science in accelerating our understanding of complex systems. I've become captivated by the life sciences and specifically how understanding cell behavior can have widespread implications on our knowledge of life and its core processes. Computational efforts will certainly play a considerable role in modeling and elucidating cell behavior. I want to contribute to the development of these computational tools in the hope of advancing our understanding of disease and its pathogenesis. </p>

        <p>Away from academics, I greatly enjoy playing pickup basketball, watching Scrubs re-runs, and eating <a href = https://www.facebook.com/berkeleyconfessions/posts/2595258690750553>La Burrita</a>!</p>
