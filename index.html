        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <p><em>Student and Undergraduate Researcher at UC Berkeley majoring in Computer Science and Molecular and Cell Biology</a></em></p>

        <p>Hi, I'm Karthik and I'm a third-year student interested in computational and systems biology! As a Computer Science major, I've developed an appreciation for the power of computation and data science in accelerating our understanding of complex systems. Over the past year, I've become fascinated by the life sciences, and specifically how understanding cell behavior can have widespread implications on our knowledge of life and its core processes. I'm excited about the opportunity to use computational systems to model and learn more about cell behavior, and hope that can lead to an improved understanding of disease and related therapeutics. </p>

        <p>Notably, I have been conducting research at the David Drubin and Georjana Barnes Lab at UC Berkeley. At the <a href="https://drubinbarneslab.berkeley.edu/">Drubin/Barnes Lab</a>, I'm working on computational modeling of actin and associated proteins at endocytic sites based on novel cryo-electron tomography data with post-docs <a href = https://drubinbarneslab.berkeley.edu/people/matt-akamatsu/>Matt Akamatsu</a> and <a href = https://drubinbarneslab.berkeley.edu/people/daniel-serwas/>Daniel Serwas</a>. This experience has been a great immersion into the world of systems biology and, along with a collaboration at the <a href = "https://sites.google.com/eng.ucsd.edu/prangamani/home">Rangamani Lab</a> at UCSD, I've learned about the  benefits of interdisciplinary cell research, at the intersection of physics, biology and computer science.</p>

        <p>Away from academics, I greatly enjoy playing pickup basketball, watching Scrubs re-runs, and eating <a href = https://www.facebook.com/berkeleyconfessions/posts/2595258690750553>La Burrita</a>!</p>
